Meeting 16.jan.2018

Performance:
	- bigger instability with rk4

Theory:
	- meaning of fd, fm - line density of force?
	- how s, s' and s'xs'' can be orthogonal
	- where to look for derivations
	- limitations of LIA (just Taylor)
	- derivation of ds/dt: fm=fd why?

Simulations:
	- temperature=0, quantum=False -> why not stable?
	- When turn off s'' norm, errors are smaller
